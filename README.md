## Emergency Alert App (Project)

An app that will allow nurses, doctors, pediatrician and other healthcare practitioners to signup to an app where they will be alerted in case someone needs a medical assistance in nearby locations. This will be helpful most specially when ambulances are not accessible to remote areas.
